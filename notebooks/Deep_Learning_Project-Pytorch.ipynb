    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "In the fall of 2016, I was a Teaching Fellow (Harvard's version of TA) for the graduate class on \"Advanced Topics in Data Science (CS209/109)\" at Harvard University. I was in-charge of designing the class project given to the students, and this tutorial has been built on top of the project I designed for the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why write yet another Tutorial on Machine Learning and Deep Learning?\n",
    "As a researcher on Computer Vision, I come across new blogs and tutorials on ML (Machine Learning) every day. However, most of them are just focussing on introducing the syntax and the terminology relevant to the field. For example - a 15 minute tutorial on Tensorflow using MNIST dataset, or a 10 minute intro to Deep Learning in Keras on Imagenet. \n",
    "\n",
    "While people are able to copy paste and run the code in these tutorials and feel that working in ML is really not that hard, it doesn't help them at all in using ML for their own purposes. For example, they never introduce you to how you can run the same algorithm on your own dataset. Or, how do you get the dataset if you want to solve a problem. Or, which algorithms do you use - Conventional ML, or Deep Learning? How do you evaluate your models performance? How do you write your own model, as opposed to choosing a ready made architecture? All these form fundamental steps in any Machine Learning pipeline, and it is these steps that take most of our time as ML practitioners. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial breaks down the whole pipeline, and leads the reader through it step by step in an hope to empower you to actually use ML, and not just feel that it was not too hard. Needless to say, this will take much longer than 15-30 minutes. I believe a weekend would be a good enough estimate.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Wow, that title sounds like a handful, right? Let's break it down step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q.1. what do we mean by Classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, the task of classification means to use the available data to learn a <i>function</i> which can assign a category to a data point. For example, assign a genre to a movie, like \"Romantic Comedy\", \"Action\", \"Thriller\". Another example could be automatically assigning a category to news articles, like \"Sports\" and \"Politics\". \n",
    "\n",
    "### More Formally \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Given:\n",
    "- A data point $x_i$ \n",
    "- A set of categories $y_1,y_2...y_n$ that $x_i$ can belong to. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task : \n",
    "Predict the correct category $y_k$ for a new data point $x_k$ not present in the given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem : \n",
    "We don't know how the $x$ and $y$ are related mathematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumption : \n",
    "We assume there exists a function $f$ relating $x$ and $y$ i.e. $f(x_i)=y_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach : \n",
    "Since $f$ is not known, we learn a function $g$, which approximates $f$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important consideration : \n",
    "- If $f(x_i)=g(x_i)=y_i$ for all $x_i$, then the two functions $f$ and $g$ are exactly equal. Needless to say, this won't realistically ever happen, and we'll only be able to approximate the true function $f$ using $g$. This means, sometimes the prediction $g(x_i)$ will not be correct. And essentially, our whole goal is to find a $g$ which makes a really low number of such errors. That's basically all that we're trying to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For the sake of completeness, I should mention that this is a specific kind of learning problem which we call \"Supervised Learning\". Also, the idea that $g$ approximates $f$ well for data not present in our dataset is called \"Generalization\". It is absolutely paramount that our model generalizes, or else all our claims will only be true about data we already have and our predictions will not be correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We will look into generalization a little bit more a little ahead in the tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, There are several other kinds, but supervised learning is the most popular and well studied kind."

    "### Q.2. What's Multi-Modal Classification then?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the machine learning community, the term Multi-Modal is used to refer to multiple <i>kinds</i> of data. For example, consider a YouTube video. It can be thought to contain 3 different modalities -\n",
    "\n",
    "- The video frames (visual modality)\n",
    "- The audio clip of what's being spoken (audio modality)\n",
    "- Some videos also come with the transcription of the words spoken in the form of subtitles (textual modality)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, that I'm interested in classifying a song on YouTube as pop or rock. You can use any of the above 3 modalities to predict the genre - The video, the song itself, or the lyrics. But, needless to say, you can predict it much better if you could use all three simultaneously. This is what we mean by multi-modal classification. "

    "For any machine learning algorithm to work, it is imperative that we collect data which is \"representative\". Now, let's take a moment to discuss what the word representative mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What data is good data? OR What do you mean by data being \"representative\"?\n",
    "Let's look at this from first principles. Mathematically, the premise of machine learning (to be precise, the strand of machine learning we'll be working with here) is that given input variable X, and an output variable y, **IF** there is a function such that g(X)=y, then if g is unknown, we can \"learn\" a function f which approximates g. At the very heart, its not at all different from what you may have earlier studied as \"curve fitting\". For example, if you're trying to predict someone's movie preferences then X can be information about the person's gender, age, nationality and so on, while y can be the genre they most like to listen to!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do a thought experiment. Consider the same example - I'm trying to predict people's movie preferences. I walk into a classroom today, and collect information about some students and their movie preferences. Now, I use that data to build a model. How well do you think I can predict my father's movie preferences? The answer is - probably not very well. Why? Intuitively, there was probably no one in the classroom who was my father's age. My model can tell me that as people go from age 18 to 30, they have a higher preference for documentaries over superhero movies. But does this trend continue at 55? Probably, they may start liking family dramas more. Probably they don't. In a nutshell, we cannot say with certainty, as our data tells us nothing about it. So, if the task was to make predictions about ANYONE's movie preferences, then the data collected from just undergraduates is NOT representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see why this makes sense Mathematically. Look at the graph below."

    "If we consider that the variable plotted on the vertical axis is $y$, and the values of the 2 variables on the horizontal axes make the input vector $X$, then, our hope is that we are able to find a function $f$ which can approximate the function plotted here. If all the data I collect is such that $x_1$ belongs to (80,100) and $x_2$ belongs to (80,100), the learned function will only be able to learn the \"yellow-green dipping bellow\" part of the function.  Our function will never be able to predict the behavior in the \"red\" regions of the true function. So, in order to be able to learn a good function, we need data sampled from a diverse set of values of $x_1$ and x2. That would be representative data to learn this contour."

    "Therefore, we want to collect data which is representative of all possible movies that we want to make predictions about. Or else (which is often the case), we need to be aware of the limitations of the model we have trained, and the predictions we can make with confidence. The easiest way to do this is to only make predictions about the domain of data we collected the training data from. For example, in our case, let us start by assuming that our model will predict genres for only English movies. Now, the task is to collect data about a diverse collection of movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we get this data then? Neither google, nor any university has released such a dataset. We want to collect visual and textual data about these movies. The simple answer is to scrape it from the internet to build our own dataset. For the purpose of this project, we will use movie posters as our visual data, and movie plots as textual data. Using these, we will build a model that can predict movie genres! "

Such inherent biases tell us that the underlying population we are sampling from itself is skewed and not balanced. We may then take steps to account for such problems. Even if we don't take such steps, it is important to be aware that we are making the assumption that an unbalanced dataset is not hurting our performance and if need be, we can come back to address this assumption.

Consider this, you have a function $f$ dependent only one dependent variable $x$, and $x$ can only integer values from 1 to 100. Since it's one dimensional, it can be plotted on a line.

The interesting bit is that instead of 100 possible values of dependent variables like before, we now have 100,000 possible values! Basically, we can make 100x100 table of possible values of $x_1$ and $x_2$. Wow, that increased exponentially. Not just figuratively, but mathematically exponentially.

In the next layer, it learns that if you combine the vectors representing vertical and horizontal vectors in different ratios, you can make all possible slanted lines. Next layer learns to combine lines to form curves - Say, something like the outline of a face. These curves come together to form 3D objects. And so on.

    "Once again, we must make an implementation decision. This time, it has more to do with how much time are we willing to spend in return for added accuracy. We are going to use here a technique that is commonly referred to as Pre-Training in Machine Learning Literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of me trying to re-invent the wheel here, I am going to borrow this short section on pre-training from Stanford University's lecture on <a href='http://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/'> CNN's</a>. To quote - \n",
    "\n",
    "''In practice, very few people train an entire Convolutional Network from scratch (with random initialization), because it is relatively rare to have a dataset of sufficient size. Instead, it is common to pretrain a ConvNet on a very large dataset (e.g. ImageNet, which contains 1.2 million images with 1000 categories), and then use the ConvNet either as an initialization or a fixed feature extractor for the task of interest. ''\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three broad ways in which transfer learning or pre-training can be done. (The 2 concepts are different and to understand the difference clearly, I suggest you read the linked lecture thoroughly). The way we are going to about it is by using a pre-trained, released ConvNet as feature extractor. Take a ConvNet pretrained on ImageNet (a popular object detection dataset), remove the last fully-connected layer. After removing the last layer, what we have is just another neural network i.e. a stack of space tranformations. But, originally the output of this stack can be pumped into a single layer which can classify the image into categories like Car, Dog, Cat and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means, is that in the space this stack transforms the images to, all images which contain a \"dog\" are closer to each other, and all images containing a \"cat\" are closer. Thus, it is a meaningful space where images with similar objects are closer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it, now if we pump our posters through this stack, it will embed them in a space where posters which contain similar objects are closer. This is a very meaningful feature engineering method! While this may not be ideal for genre prediction, it might be quite meaningful. For example, all posters with a gun or a car are probably action. While a smiling couple would point to romance or drama. The alternative would be to train the CNN from scratch which is fairly computationally intensive and involves a lot of tricks to get the CNN training to converge to the optimal space tranformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we can start off with something strong, and then build on top. We pump our images through the pre-trained network to extract the visual features from the posters. Then, using these features as descriptors for the image, and genres as the labels, we train a simpler neural network from scratch which learns to do simply classification on this dataset. These 2 steps are exactly what we are going to do for predicting genres from movie posters."

    "This looks odd, why are we re-running the loop we ran above again below? The reason is simple, the most important thing to know about numpy is that using vstack() and hstack() are highly sub-optimal. Numpy arrays when created, a fixed size is allocated in the memory and when we stack, a new one is copied and created in a new location. This makes the code really, really slow. The best way to do it (and this remains the same with MATLAB matrices if you work with them), is to create a numpy array of zeros, and over-write it row by row. The above code was just to see what size numpy array we will need!"

    "\n",
    "\"\"Sometimes, we tend to get lost in the jargon and confuse things easily, so the best way to go about this is getting back to our basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t forget what the original premise of machine learning (and thus deep learning) is - IF the input and output are related by a function y=f(x), then if we have x, there is no way to exactly know f unless we know the process itself. However, machine learning gives you the ability to approximate f with a function g, and the process of trying out multiple candidates to identify the function g best approximating f is called machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, that was machine learning, and how is deep learning different? Deep learning simply tries to expand the possible kind of functions that can be approximated using the above mentioned machine learning paradigm. Roughly speaking, if the previous model could learn say 10,000 kinds of functions, now it will be able to learn say 100,000 kinds (in actuality both are infinite spaces but one is larger than the other, because maths is cool that ways.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know the mathematics of it, go read about VC dimension and how more layers in a network affect it. But I will avoid the mathematics here and rely on your intuition to believe me when I say that not all data can be classified correctly into categories using a linear function. So, we need our deep learning model to be able to approximate more complex functions than just a linear function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s come to your non linearity bit. Imagine a linear function y=2x+3, and another one y=4x+7. What happens if I pool them and take an average? I get another linear function y= 3x+5. So instead of doing those two computations separately and then averaging it out, I could have just used the single linear function y=3x+5. Obviously, this logic holds good if I have more than 2 such linear functions. This is exactly what will happen if you don’t have have non-linearities in your nodes, and also what others have written in their answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It simply follows from the definition of a linear function -\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) If you take two linear functions, AND\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii)Take a linear combination of them (which is how we combine the outputs of multiple nodes of a network)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are BOUND to get a linear function because f(x)+g(x)=mx+b+nx+c=(m+n)x+(b+c)= say h(x).\n",
    "\n",
    "And you could in essence replace your whole network by a simple matrix transformation which accounts for all linear combinations and up/downsamplings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, you’ll only be trying to learn a linear approximation for original function f relating the input and the output. Which as we discussed above, is not always the best approximation. Adding non-linearities ensures that you can learn more complex functions by approximating every non-linear function as a LINEAR combination of a large number of non-linear functions.\n",

With a larger dataset, and more training I was able to bring these numbers to as high as 70%, which is the similar to textual features. Some teams in my class outperformed this even more. More data is the first thing you should try if you want better results. Then, you can start playing with training on GPUs, learning rate schedules and other hyperparameters. Finally, you can consider using ResNet, a much more powerful neural network model than VGG. All of these can be tried once you have a working knowledge of machine learning."

    "Congrats! This is the end of our pilot project! Needless to say, a lot of the above content may be new to you, or may be things that you know very well. If it's the former, I hope this tutorial would have helped you. If it is the latter and you think I wrote something incorrect or that my understanding can be improved, feel free to create a github issue so that I can correct it! \n",

    "Writing tutorials can take a lot of time, but it is a great learning experience. I am currently working on a tutorial focussing on word embeddings, which will explore word2vec and other word embeddings in detail. While it will take some time to be up, I will post a link to it's repository on the README for this project so that interested readers can find it.\n",

    "I would like to thank a few of my friends who had an indispensible role to play in me making this tutorial. Firstly, Professor Hanspeter Pfister and Verena Kaynig at Harvard, who helped guide this tutorial/project and scope it. Secondly, my friends Sahil Loomba and Matthew Tancik for their suggestions and editing the material and the presentation of the storyline. Thirdly, Zoya Bylinskii at MIT for constantly motivating me to put in my effort into this tutorial. Finally, all others who helped me feel confident enough to take up this task and to see it till the end. Thanks all of you!"
